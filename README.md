# Netflix's Most Popular Shows (R)

Which are Netflix's Top 10 most popular shows of all time? How does the global audience for these titles compare to historic global TV broadcasts? <br>

To find out, I used R to analysed data for 2,600 Netflix titles and uncovered some fascinating insights. <br>

### ðŸ’¡ Key findings:
- Humanity has spent more time watching *'Squid Game: Season 1'* than the historic moon landings ðŸŒ• <br>
- Live TV isnâ€™t dead yet! ðŸ“º *'Stranger Things 4'* viewership took a dramatic hit during World Cup qualifying matches âš½ <br>


### ðŸ“Š Analytical approach:
 - **Data Wrangling:** cleaned and structured the dataset for analysis <br>
 - **Exploratory Data Analysis:** identified trends and outliers in viewership data <br>
 - **Visualisation:** used *ggplot2* to create compelling charts highlighting key trends <br>
